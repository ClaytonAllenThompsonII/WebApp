<p>The general plan:
</p>

<p>Collect images of the top 50% of products by Inventory Spend, across Food, Wine, Liquor, Beer, and Beverage. </p>
<p> Food: 15-20 products</p>
<p> Wine: less than 10 products</p>
<p> Liquor: less than 10 products</p>
<p> Beer: less than 10 products</p>
<p> Beverage: less than 10 products</p>

<p>Next update: I will start making lists of top 50% of products and repsective general ledger code, across each of the 5 categories. </p>

<h4>Cost Curve Dashboard</h4>
<b></b>

<p> Cost Curve helps restaurants manage their inventory and invoices. 
</p>

<p>Our technology allows restaurants to :</p>
<ul>
    <li> Measure, classify, and process <b>inventory</b> <i>rapidly.</i></li>
    <li> Extract, model, store, and create journal entries for invoices.  </li>
</ul>
<p> This page will serve as a "finger tip feel" of the users buisness. </p>
<p> The page will feature key KPIs and dynamic data visuals</p>

<p> Need to establish solid data architecture before we can build this page out.</p>
